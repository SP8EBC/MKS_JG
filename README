The MKS_JG is a piece of software which I'm developing for the Interschool Sport Club in Jelenia Góra - Luge Division.
Jelenia Góra is a city in south-west Poland in Lower Silesian Voivodeships, very close to the Karkonosze Mountains (aka Krkonoše aka Riesengebirge)
and Poland-Czech border

The MKS_JG app will serve as a complex solution for timekeeping during competitions & training which we/they will organize. Timekeeping is understood
as many different features like:

-> Handling communication with external time measurement hardware.
-> Creating start lists for different kind of competition and storing run times inside them.
-> Calculating scoring and "sport ranks" (thing specific to "polish professional sport system").
-> Supporting luge specific functionalities like pre-sliders, team relay, doubles etc. 
-> Generating reports with scores.
-> Handling competitors data and maintaing theirs statistics over longer period of time.

The software is highly oriented on the sport of luge and IMHO it will be rather unusuable in any other sport discipline, or it will require
very high level of "abstraction" to map luge specific functions to what is needed for instance in running. Software is written in JavaSE 8
using Swing as GUI library and Spring as things like IoC/DI, ORM etc..

Code is well commented but all commentary and also JavaDoc is written in Polish, to help any other software developer which maybe will do any
work on this SW in future (I think he/she  will be rather from PL). All classes, variables, fields etc are named in English, so with knowledge
about Java/Swing/Spring and basic fan-knowledge about luge it will be possible to understood what is going on in the code.
